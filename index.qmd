My name is Dr Jonny Batty and I am an academic cardiology doctor, based in the [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/) (LIDA) at the University of Leeds. I am passionate about using routinely-collected healthcare data to better understand health and disease, and to build tools that can be used to improve clinical care.

During my PhD, I am using advanced statistical methods to explore the impact of different patterns of multiple long-term conditions in people diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. This has kindly been funded by [The Wellcome Trust](https://www.4wardnorth.org.uk/) and is supervised by [Dr Marlous Hall](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/medicine/staff/390/dr-marlous-hall), Principal Investigator of the [Survivorship and Multimorbidity Epidemiology research group](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/research-projects/survivorship-and-multimorbidity-epidemiology/).

I'll use this as a place to share code snippets, presentations, publications and other thoughts.
