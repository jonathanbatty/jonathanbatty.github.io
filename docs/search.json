I am passionate about using routinely-collected healthcare data to better understand health and disease, and to build tools that can be used to improve clinical care.\nDuring my PhD, I plan to use advanced statistical methods to explore the impact of different patterns of multiple long-term conditions in people diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction. This has kindly been funded by The Wellcome Trust. My lead supervisor is Dr Marlous Hall, PI of the Survivorship and Multimorbidity Epidemiology research group.\nI’ll probably use this as a place to share code snippets, presentations, publications and other thoughts."
